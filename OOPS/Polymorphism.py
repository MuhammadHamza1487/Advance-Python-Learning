# The below code shows how Python can use two different class types, in the same way. We create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. Then call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is. We assume that these methods actually exist in each class. 


class India():
    def capital(self):
        print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

    def language(self):
        print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")

    def type(self):
        print("India is a developing country.")

class USA():
    def capital(self):
        print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

    def language(self):
        print("English is the primary language of USA.")

    def type(self):
        print("USA is a developed country.")

obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()
for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
    country.capital()
    country.language()
    country.type()

# Polymorphism with Inheritance: 
# In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.  


class Bird:
  def intro(self):
    print("There are many types of birds.")
    
  def flight(self):
    print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")
  
class sparrow(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Sparrows can fly.")
    
class ostrich(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Ostriches cannot fly.")
    
obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = sparrow()
obj_ost = ostrich()

obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()

obj_spr.intro()
obj_spr.flight()

obj_ost.intro()
obj_ost.flight()

# polymorphism in Python using inheritance and method overriding:

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement this method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Create a list of Animal objects
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

# Call the speak method on each object
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
