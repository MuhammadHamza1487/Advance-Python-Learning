# Python Classes and Objects
# Last Updated : 14 Jul, 2024
# A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it to maintain its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

# To understand the need for creating a class and object in Python let’s consider an example, let’s say you wanted to track the number of dogs that may have different attributes like breed and age. If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes.

# Object of Python Class
# In Python programming an Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.

# An object consists of:
# 1. State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
# 2. Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
# 3. Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.


# __init__() method ______________________________________________________________________________________

# The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

# Sample class with init method
class Person:

    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Sample Method
    def say_hi(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)


p = Person('Nikhil')
p.say_hi()


# __str__() method ______________________________________________________________________________________

# Python has a particular method called __str__(). that is used to define how a class object should be represented as a string. It is often used to give an object a human-readable textual representation, which is helpful for logging, debugging, or showing users object information. When a class object is used to create a string using the built-in functions print() and str(), the __str__() function is automatically used. You can alter how objects of a class are represented in strings by defining the __str__() method.
class GFG:
    def __init__(self, name, company):
        self.name = name
        self.company = company

    def __str__(self):
        return f"My name is {self.name} and I work in {self.company}."


my_obj = GFG("John", "GeeksForGeeks")
print(my_obj)

# Defining instance variables using a constructor. 
# Python3 program to show that the variables with a value
# assigned in the class declaration, are class variables and
# variables inside methods and constructors are instance
# variables.

# Class for Dog


class Dog:

    # Class Variable
    animal = 'dog'

    # The init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, breed, color):

        # Instance Variable
        self.breed = breed
        self.color = color


# Objects of Dog class
Rodger = Dog("Pug", "brown")
Buzo = Dog("Bulldog", "black")

print('Rodger details:')
print('Rodger is a', Rodger.animal)
print('Breed: ', Rodger.breed)
print('Color: ', Rodger.color)

print('\nBuzo details:')
print('Buzo is a', Buzo.animal)
print('Breed: ', Buzo.breed)
print('Color: ', Buzo.color)

# Class variables can be accessed using class
# name also
print("\nAccessing class variable using class name")
print(Dog.animal)
