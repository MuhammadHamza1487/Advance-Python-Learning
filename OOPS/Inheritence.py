# Example of Inheritance in Python 
# Let us see an example of simple Python inheritance in which a child class is inheriting the properties of its parent class. In this example, ‘Person’ is the parent class, and ‘Employee’ is its child class.

# A Python program to demonstrate inheritance
 
# Base or Super class. Note object in bracket.
# (Generally, object is made ancestor of all classes)
# In Python 3.x "class Person" is
# equivalent to "class Person(object)"
 
 
class Person(object):
 
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
 
    # To get name
    def getName(self):
        return self.name
 
    # To check if this person is an employee
    def isEmployee(self):
        return False
 
 
# Inherited or Subclass (Note Person in bracket)
class Employee(Person):
 
    # Here we return true
    def isEmployee(self):
        return True
 
 
# Driver code
emp = Person("Geek1")  # An Object of Person
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())
 
emp = Employee("Geek2")  # An Object of Employee
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())

# Subclassing (Calling constructor of parent class)

# Python code to demonstrate how parent constructors
# are called.
 
# parent class
class Person(object):
 
    # __init__ is known as the constructor
    def __init__(self, name, idnumber):
        self.name = name
        self.idnumber = idnumber
 
    def display(self):
        print(self.name)
        print(self.idnumber)
 
# child class
class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, idnumber, salary, post):
        self.salary = salary
        self.post = post
 
        # invoking the __init__ of the parent class
        Person.__init__(self, name, idnumber)
 
# creation of an object variable or an instance
a = Employee('Rahul', 886012, 200000, "Intern")
 
# calling a function of the class Person using its instance
a.display()

# The super() Function
# In this example, we created the object ‘obj’ of the child class. When we called the constructor of the child class ‘Student’, it initialized the data members to the values passed during the object creation. Then using the super() function, we invoked the constructor of the parent class.


# parent class
class Person():
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
 
  def display(self):
    print(self.name, self.age)
 
# child class
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.sName = name
    self.sAge = age
    # inheriting the properties of parent class
    super().__init__("Rahul", age)
 
  def displayInfo(self):
    print(self.sName, self.sAge)
 
obj = Student("Mayank", 23)
obj.display()
obj.displayInfo()

# Different types of Python Inheritance
# There are 5 different types of inheritance in Python. They are as follows:

# Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an example above.
# Multiple inheritances: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritances. 
# Unlike Java, python shows multiple inheritances.

# Python example to show the working of multiple
# inheritance

class Base1(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.str1 = "Geek1"
		print("Base1")


class Base2(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.str2 = "Geek2"
		print("Base2")


class Derived(Base1, Base2):
	def __init__(self):

		# Calling constructors of Base1
		# and Base2 classes
		Base1.__init__(self)
		Base2.__init__(self)
		print("Derived")

	def printStrs(self):
		print(self.str1, self.str2)


ob = Derived()
ob.printStrs()

# Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship. This means that a child class will inherit from its parent class, which in turn is inheriting from its parent class.

# Base or Super class. Note object in bracket.
# (Generally, object is made ancestor of all classes)
# In Python 3.x "class Person" is
# equivalent to "class Person(object)"
 
class Base(object):
 
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
 
    # To get name
    def getName(self):
        return self.name
 
 
# Inherited or Sub class (Note Person in bracket)
class Child(Base):
 
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        Base.__init__(self, name)
        self.age = age
 
    # To get name
    def getAge(self):
        return self.age
 
# Inherited or Sub class (Note Person in bracket)
 
 
class GrandChild(Child):
 
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        Child.__init__(self, name, age)
        self.address = address
 
    # To get address
    def getAddress(self):
        return self.address
 
 
# Driver code
g = GrandChild("Geek1", 23, "Noida")
print(g.getName(), g.getAge(), g.getAddress())

# Private members of the parent class 
# We don’t always want the instance variables of the parent class to be inherited by the child class i.e. we can make some of the instance variables of the parent class private, which won’t be available to the child class. 

# In Python inheritance, we can make an instance variable private by adding double underscores before its name. For example:


class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.c = 21
 
        # d is private instance variable
        self.__d = 42
 
 
class D(C):
    def __init__(self):
        self.e = 84
        C.__init__(self)
 
object1 = D()

# produces an error as d is private instance variable
print(object1.c)
print(object1.__d)
